Quoddy is part of the ScrewPile suite of tools for building intelligent applications.

Why "Quoddy?"

We like lighthouses, so Quoddy is named after the famous West Quoddy Head Lighthouse.

Ok, but what does it do?

Quoddy is basically a sort of "mini Facebook" like social-networking interface. It builds on the APIs for 
social-graph management, activity-stream, activity profiling, tagging, etc. Provides the front-end 
for managing connections and for letting users provide information about themselves, their interests, 
etc. But unlike Facebook, no silly Pirates vs. Ninjas or Farmville stuff.
