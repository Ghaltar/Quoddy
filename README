Quoddy is part of the ScrewPile suite of tools for building intelligent applications.

Why "Quoddy?"

We like lighthouses, so Quoddy is named after the famous West Quoddy Head Lighthouse.

Ok, but what does it do?

Quoddy is basically a sort of "mini Facebook" like social-networking interface. It builds on the APIs for 
social-graph management, activity-stream, activity profiling, tagging, etc. Provides the front-end 
for managing connections and for letting users provide information about themselves, their interests, 
etc. But unlike Facebook, no silly Pirates vs. Ninjas or Farmville stuff.

How does it work?

Quoddy stores information about users, relationships between those users (eg, "friend", "follower," etc), groups,
relationships between users and "things" that are of interest to the user, and provides for management of those
relationships, as well as using those relationships to show a user updates regarding activity within their
network (of friends, followers and other "things).

Quoddy can also be combined with Neddick (https://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick) and Heceta (https://github.com/fogbeam/Heceta)
to provide a rich, tightly integrated platform for knowledge discovery, navigation and management.

What about OpenSocial?

Work is currently underway to add OpenSocial container support, using Apache Shindig.  When finished, this work
will allow a Quoddy instance to host any valid OpenSocial application.
